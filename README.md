Monte-Carlo Simulation (Jupyter Notebook)

## So what is this simulation?
In short - the Monte Carlo simulation uses random variables to simulate models. This is repeatedly to experiment and perform regression analysis. As we know in finance, indexes and calculations change all the time. what this would do (to some what degree) is to anticipate unexpected spikes, thus allowing there to be
